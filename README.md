WearUp is a project initially conceived for mobile apps (iOS/Android), but transformed into a web-app for this initial phase of its life.
It wants revolutionize and innovate what is currently the classic experience that brands offer to the customer during the purchase phase through various e-commerce and various smartphone apps. What WearUp wants to offer is a "purchasing awareness" experience, combining fun and seriousness, exploiting the most cutting-edge technologies such as 3D experience and Augmented Reality for the virtual try-on.

Questa demo offre all'utente di sfruttare il dettaglio che solo la tecnologia 3D √® in grado di ofrrire.
L'utente pu√≤ "giocare" con alcuni modelli di prova senza registrarsi per testare il prodotto, oppure accedere per avere l'elenco completo dei prodotti a disposizione. L'accesso pu√≤ avvenire come "user", ovvero utente semplice con account e gestione dei preferiti, oppure come "brand", dedicato a tutti i marchi di moda innovativi che decidono di sfruttare la potenzialit√† di questa app caricando i propri prodotti digitali mettendoli a disposizione del grande pubblico.

CHOOSE BETTER.  
BE AWARE.  
WEAR IT UP.
